## DEW-B Dataset

The DEW-B (Date Estimation in the Wild - Balanced) dataset, aims to provide more training images for the years that are less represented in the [DEW dataset](https://www.radar-service.eu/radar/en/dataset/tJzxrsYUkvPklBOw), from 1930 to 1969. The contributed training data has been harvested from three sources: the [LAION-5B dataset](https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/), and the [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/) and [Europeana](https://www.europeana.eu/es) web portals.

## DEXPERT Model

The proposed DEXPERT model consists of an object detector, an ensemble of Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs) experts, and a Transformer encoder that aggregates the information from the different experts to generate a final prediction.
